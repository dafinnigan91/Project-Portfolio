Hi, David here!

Please find within this repo a collection of projects I compleated for my MSc in Artifical Intelligence and adaptive systems.

Currently, this repo contains the following;

  Daisy + forest world.py 
    This Simulation is an extended simulation of the famous Daisy World experiment, created by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson. 
    Lovelock and Watson proposed a simple computer model that illustrates how life can regulate its planetary environment homeostatically.
    I extended this idea in my A-Life module to include a range of forest and land cover types, each with its own albedo values.
    The output shows a Graph where the X-axis is solar luminosity, and the Y-axis shows the area covered by each forest/land cover type.
      
      * Download and run the program as is. 
      * This program requires the Python scripting language, numpy and matplotlib as prerequisites, but no specific data is needed to run.
